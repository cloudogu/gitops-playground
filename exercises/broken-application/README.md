# Exercise: Broken Application

This application does not run. Can you figure out how to resolve these errors?
Try applying `broken-application.yaml` with `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f broken-application.yaml
```

When you resolved all errors, you should be able to access the application. 
Look into the service definition on how to access it.
